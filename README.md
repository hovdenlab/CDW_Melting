# Simulation of CDW Melting
Supplemental scripts for the manuscript "The Melting of Charge Density Waves in Low Dimensions". These scripts were used to simulate the melting of 2D CDWs. 

We simulate the melting by mobile charge centers which hop according to Boltzmann statistics ($e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}}$) through a Monte Carlo (MC) process. The interaction energy between charge centers is calculated using a shifted Lennard Jones potential truncated at 100 angstroms. This effectively treats high-temperature CDWs as a phenomenological charge crystal. CDW amplitude collapse is modeled with the removal of charge centers at topological defect sites. The simulation is of a grand canonical ensemble (varying particle count, constant volume and temperature). Every 150 iterations, we remove a charge center with the lowest $\Psi_6$ order parameter until we reach a minimum energy configuration.

To simulate melting, execute the Matlab script: `fluctuate_unit_charge_melting.m`. System parameters are directly tuned in the file. `mul` sets the initial partical count. `meltIter` sets the initial number of MC iterations,  and `relaxIter` sets the number of MC iterations after a site is removed/added. `temp_idxs` set the desired temperature to be simulated. `num_add` and `num_remove` are the maximum number of particles that can be added/removed in the simulation. The Lennard-Jones potential is defined by `rmin`, `r_c`, and `ep` which dicatate the energy minimum position, cutoff distance, and well depth, respectively.

## Large CDW system melting
We include the directory `large_melting_systems` which we use to simulate large scale melting with a parallelized approach. We initially melt the CDW with a Monte Carlo simulation of the NPT ensemble (constant particle count, temperature, and pressure). Subsequently at each temperature slice, we identify and remove topological defect sites until a constant volume, minimum energy configuration is obtained using the same procedure as above. The charge removal relaxation process for all temperatures were simulated in parallel on the University of Michigan Great Lakes HPC Cluster for a total time of over 90 CPU-days (Fig 3a-f).

The initial NPT-MC melting simulation is executed with the Matlab script: `melt_classical.m`. Like above, `mul` sets the initial partical count. `numIter` sets the number of MC iterations. `temp_idxs` set the desired temperature to be simulated. The Lennard-Jones potential is defined by `rmin`, `r_c`, and `ep` which dicatate the energy minimum position, cutoff distance, and well depth, respectively. `relax_topologial_defects.m` operates on each temperature slice. `kill_iters` sets the maximum number of charge centers that can be removed. `numIter` sets the number of MC iterations after a site is removed.
